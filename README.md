# Garage Gym

Garage Gym was my Diploma Thesis for my HTL-Diploma (german for HÃ¶here Technische Lehranstalt). 

It's a website based on a gym in Albania which has features likes DB Connection with PDOs and administrative features. Also features Forgot Password with hCaptcha and possibilities for the user to edit their profile.

The link to the site is [Garage Gym](http://garagegym.htl-projekt.com).

The structure is created with Bootstrap mostly with the help of JQuery in some sites like the navbar and index.php, but it's not only my work in here, rather the work of 4 individuals. 

My work was mostly the Back-End :

* Login
* Register
* Administration
* DB Connectivity
* Forgot Password
